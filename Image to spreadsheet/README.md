This folder contains files for image to spreadsheet project. 
Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I I decided to make something similar and add a few more functionality in the excel part

 
However one needs to manually write the subroutine in the excel file generated from the jupyter
notebook. 1 subroutine for filling cells with appropriate color and one to reverse this.

 Add a few buttons, assign macros to it and you are
done. With a click of these button you can turn your lifeless
spreadsheet into an image. 

The final product should be something like the final_product file.
For any queries be sure to contact me.
